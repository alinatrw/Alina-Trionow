            <p><strong>SENSORIUM</strong> is a network for developing the SENSORIUM method as a work of Socially Engaged Art, a constant experiment, a never-ending work-in-progress.</p>
    
            <p>We do not pursue a standardised moral concept but advocate an ethic of relationality. Our aim is to decondition ourselves from our own socialised and capitalistically shaped habitual patterns. SENSORIUM evaporates a clear concern against the capitalisation of the body and commercialisation of life. Through performative actions, we explore what this means on a practical level for our social, political and ethical coexistence.</p>
    
            <p>SENSORIUM is not an organism in which a determined whole is to be maintained, but a dynamic network of subjects. Structurally, we embody this approach through horizontal forms of organisation by the maxim of equity and not equality. Depending on their personal needs and requirements, all participants have the free power to organise meetings, projects and performances in line with the SENSORIUM method.</p>
    
            <p>Our collective practice is rooted in radical approaches of performance art and actions from various avant-garde movements of the 20th century, such as Fluxus, The Living Theatre, and Viennese Actionism. Starting from our own present, we are now asking how to create New Radicalities. What does this term mean today? How does its meaning and necessity shift depending on different personal realities and different environments?</p>
    
            <p>Through the ongoing practice of formulating and re-interpreting <em>SENSORIUM</em> manifestos, and score-based actions, we are constantly reconstituting the experience of communality. <em>SENSORIUM</em> lives through an ongoing collective exchange across international borders and through a non-dualistic and non-hierarchical conception of life.</p>
