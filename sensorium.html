        <section class="bio">
    
            <p><strong>SENSORIUM</strong> is an open network for developing the SENSORIUM method as a work of Socially Engaged Art. Created in 2024 by the August Group, Maddie Marone <a href="https://madelinemarone.com" class="arrow-link" target="_blank">>></a> (1996, USA), Louis Meïko Touraille (2001, France), Marco Galletti (1987, Italy) and Alina Trionow (2001, Germany), we explore a constant experiment, a never-ending work-in-progress as an artistic concept.</p>
    
            <p>The method doesn't pursue a standardised moral concept but advocate an ethic of relationality. Our aim is to decondition ourselves from our own socialised and capitalistically shaped habitual patterns. SENSORIUM evaporates a clear concern against the capitalisation of the body and commercialisation of life. Through performative actions, we explore what this means on a practical level for our social, political and ethical coexistence.</p>
    
            <p>SENSORIUM is not an organism in which a determined whole is to be maintained, but a dynamic network of subjects. Structurally, we embody this approach through horizontal forms of organisation by the maxim of equity and not equality. Depending on their personal needs and requirements, all participants have the free power to organise meetings, projects and performances in line with the SENSORIUM method.</p>
    
            <p>Our collective practice is rooted in radical approaches of performance art and actions from various avant-garde movements of the 20th century, such as Fluxus, The Living Theatre, and Viennese Actionism. Starting from our own present, we are now asking how to create New Radicalities. What does this term mean today? How does its meaning and necessity shift depending on different personal realities and different environments?</p>
    
            <p>Through the ongoing practice of formulating and re-interpreting <em>SENSORIUM</em> manifestos, and score-based actions, we are constantly reconstituting the experience of communality. <em>SENSORIUM</em> lives through an ongoing collective exchange across international borders and through a non-dualistic and non-hierarchical conception of life.</p>

                We are putting everything flat on the table.<br>

                All have the same value as any other materials.

                    SENSORIUM MANIFESTO 
                    
                    0.  
                    
                    SENSORIUM is a social practice.
                    SENSORIUM exists only in a process-orientated way. 
                    SENSORIUM declares events to be the central statement.
                    
                    The manifesto is a method.
                    The manifesto is undogmatic.
                    
                
                    1. TRANSGRESSION
                    
                    We pursue an active principle.
                    Activity is the opposite of apathy.
                    The being is active in its principle.
                    Activity is permanent movement.
                    It works through the process.
                    
                    The active principle is amoral. 
                    It transgresses. 
                    It gives birth to itself through destruction. 
                    It understands everything that exists as information, not as judgement.
                    
                    SENSORIUM is the framework for transgression.
                    

                    2.  REWILDING
                    
                    Our subject is the entire spectrum of sensation.
                    The treatment is performative.
                    By transgressing one’s own and social boundaries
                    the relationship between all emotions is horizontal.
                    
                    Our occasion is the reorganization
                    of our physical condition,
                    of our mental attitude,
                    of our social existence.
                    
                    SENSORIUM is the withdrawal from the intervention in sensation through judgement.
                    

                    3. CHAOS 
                    
                    Transgression opens an empty space.
                    Total chaos rains in it.
                    Totality doesn’t know the second.
                    It’s a state outside of time.
                    
                    Chaos is a shape-shifter.
                    It reveals itself ambivalently.
                    In the simultaneity of creation and destruction
                    it has not yet enacted a law.
                    
                    We follow chaos through Performance without knowing where it leads.
                    
                    SENSORIUM is the revitalization of chaos.
                    

                    4. IMPROVISATION/ INSTINCT
                    
                    We untie the instinct through improvisation.
                    We cultivate spontaneity and freedom.
                    During improvisation, the real experience appears.
                    Poetry and life merge into synchronicity.
                    
                    Instinct leads the way through chaos.
                    

                    5. ART AND LIFE 
                    
                    The being is poetic in its essence 
                    and therefore significant and meaningless at the same time.
                    Poetry is the highest form of freedom. 
                    So art and life mean the same thing.
                    
                    Performance happens in the active moment.
                    The play always happens and never happens.
                    

                    6. BODY
                    
                    The body is unbounded.
                    The body is nameless.
                    The body is a material.
                    
                    Tantamount with rain, time, wind, sun and sand.
                    We understand it as a sensual medium for exploration of the self.
                    Through performative action, we transport it into chaos.
                    To where meaning has not been assigned.
                    

                    7. MATERIAL
                    
                    Everything that exists is material.
                    People, matter, rain, time, wind, sun and sand.
                    Every material has an equal status.
                    It acts. 
                    
                    It mediates and communicates. It appears.
                    Its appearance contains information.
                    Without symbolism, it speaks metaphysically and associatively. 
                    Its very existence is an action. 
                    

                    8. LANGUAGE 
                    
                    Language is the mediation of information.
                    Language is an expression.
                    It begins non-verbally. 
                    We speak through silence.
                    Silence speaks to us.
                    
                    Through performative action we forget all words
                    and begin to speak.
                    

                    9. PUBLIC
                    
                    The audience feels through participation.
                    Sensation creates a form.
                    Every form contains information through its expression.
                    Everything that conveys information acts through its effect.
                    The public is part of a landscape.
                    

                    10. COMMUNALITY
                    
                    We delimit ourselves through performative practice. 
                    
                    Collective transgression let us temporally become one.
                    This unity is non-hierarchical.
                    We develop a sense for horizontal communality.
                    We treat care and challenge as a pair.
                    

                    11. TIME AND SPACE
                    
                    A space is formed by what it contains.
                    Content is related to the present.
                    The present is an accumulation of temporality.
                    
                    Every person, every object, every material is content.
                    Their simultaneity is the action. 
                    Every action is therefore site-specific. 
                    No action is repeatable.
