            <p><strong>SENSORIUM</strong> is an open network for developing the SENSORIUM method as a work of Socially Engaged Art. Created in 2024 by the August Group, Maddie Marone <a href="https://madelinemarone.com" class="arrow-link" target="_blank">>></a> (1996, USA), Louis Meïko Touraille (2001, France), Marco Galletti (1987, Italy) and Alina Trionow (2001, Germany), we explore a constant experiment, a never-ending work-in-progress as an artistic concept.</p>
    
            <p>The method doesn't pursue a standardised moral concept but advocate an ethic of relationality. Our aim is to decondition ourselves from our own socialised and capitalistically shaped habitual patterns. SENSORIUM evaporates a clear concern against the capitalisation of the body and commercialisation of life. Through performative actions, we explore what this means on a practical level for our social, political and ethical coexistence.</p>
    
            <p>SENSORIUM is not an organism in which a determined whole is to be maintained, but a dynamic network of subjects. Structurally, we embody this approach through horizontal forms of organisation by the maxim of equity and not equality. Depending on their personal needs and requirements, all participants have the free power to organise meetings, projects and performances in line with the SENSORIUM method.</p>
    
            <p>Our collective practice is rooted in radical approaches of performance art and actions from various avant-garde movements of the 20th century, such as Fluxus, The Living Theatre, and Viennese Actionism. Starting from our own present, we are now asking how to create New Radicalities. What does this term mean today? How does its meaning and necessity shift depending on different personal realities and different environments?</p>
    
            <p>Through the ongoing practice of formulating and re-interpreting <em>SENSORIUM</em> manifestos, and score-based actions, we are constantly reconstituting the experience of communality. <em>SENSORIUM</em> lives through an ongoing collective exchange across international borders and through a non-dualistic and non-hierarchical conception of life.</p>

                  <p>MANIFESTO NO. 4

              FORWARD: NOTE TO THE READER:
              
              In the collapse of certain ‘established’ structures,
              Sensorium (We) find an opening for rebirth and realization.
              Events and suffering create openings, happenings into
              realization, in order to discover what we are, what we are
              not, and who we are beyond the ego, and move beyond where we
              are now.
              “There’s a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets
              in.” Leonard Cohen
              Sensorium is a crack in the societal structure, in the
              structure of our own egos. Sensorium created an opening
              through which light shines in.
              (We) are awakening now, by choice.
              
              
              1. OUT OF HEAD LOGIC AND INTO EMBODIED PRACTICE/
              SPIRITUAL BEING
              
              Sensorium (We), move out of logic into abstracted meaning;
              (We) move beyond rational human experience into poetry.
              ART/LIFE/POETRY
              Sensorium (We), believe life is only poetry, art is only
              poetry, and they become one.
              
              
              1. NON-HIERARCHY: MATERIALS
              
              Sensorium (We), maintain that if life and art are the
              same, so are materials, in their non-dualistic and non-
              hierarchical natures. A human arm, is the same as milk, is
              the same as a canvas. A human arm is the same as human
              genitals, and a human face, etc.
              Each material is treated with respect and conscious
              attention.
              
              
              2. ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS
              
              Sensorium (We), create through performance, an opening for
              chaos to enter a state of liminality, in order to reset
              ourselves and find resonance.
              
              3. BEING HERE NOW
              
              THE CLAUSE OF RADICAL PRESENCE
              RADICAL PRESENCE:
              WHAT IS RADICAL PRESENCE?
              Radical Presence is attuning to the practice of being here
              and now, surrendering totally in acceptance to what is here
              and now.
              
              
              4. USE OF IMPROVISATION/ INSTINCT
              
              Sensorium (We), use improvisation and instinct as tools for
              performance and life-making. Openings provide themselves to
              us or are created by us, through engagement with Radical
              Presence, the act of being here now.
              
              5. BOUNDARY CROSSING
              
              Sensorium (We), actively explore(s) boundary crossing
              through art-life partitions going outside social norms into
              radicality. We explore shifting perceptions, facing fears
              and moving reality.
              
              
              6. IDENTITY FUSION/ COMMUNITY/ AUTONOMY
              
              Sensorium (We), work(s) with identity fusion to create
              collective non-hierarchical bodies with common stances, in
              which the community is valued over individual comfort, and
              all individuals have equitable autonomy and decision-making
              power.
              
              
              7. INFORMATION NOT JUDGEMENT/ ART-LIFE PARTITIONS
              
              Sensorium (We), aim(s) to perceive all input as information
              and not as a value judgement. Sensorium (We), experience
              life and art as equal, interconnected and with a fluid
              permeable skin. (We) value pleasant situations with equal
              weight and importance as painful ones.
              (We) have an anti-hierarchical approach to a spectrum of
              emotions, sensations, and experiences.
              
              
              8. NUDITY
              
              Sensorium (We), explore(s) nudity, as a way to deconstruct
              societal rules, and liberate natural bodies.
              
              
              9. ON LANGUAGE
              
              Sensorium (We), maintain that language is a ‘sin,’ and a
              service. Language can be simply sound material and can be
              deconstructed as an associative sensory tool.
              
              10. POST-ACTIONISM/ CONTEXTUALISATION
              
              Sensorium (We), come out of an Actionist, Happening and
              Fluxus driven context, as well as its lingering social and
              political backgrounds. (We) engage actively in what could
              be considered Post-Actionism, or the third wave of avant-
              garde.
              
              
              11. OTHER THAN HUMAN STRUCTURES
              
              Sensorium (We), aim to move towards non-human forms and
              take inspiration from ecosystems, and structures present in
              mycelium and rhizoids.
              
              
              12. WE CANNOT LIVE, WE CANNOT CHANGE, IF WE DO NOT ACCEPT
              
              Sensorium (We), détournons civilization as an oppressive
              rule or structure and aim to ‘return or create’ a natural
              existence together.
              
              
              *SENSORIUM ELABORATES ON RESEARCH METHODS OF ITS MEMBERS ON A
              CONTINUAL BASIS. SENSORIUM ENCOMPASSES THE ALTERED STATES OF
              CONSCIOUSNESS RESEARCH, BODY MANIPULATION RESEARCH,

                  <p>MANIFESTO NO. 3

              SENSORIUM DEVELOPS THE RESEARCH  
              METHODS OF ITS MEMBERS ON AN ONGOING  
              BASIS.
              
              SENSORIUM INCLUDES THE RESEARCH ON  
              ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS,  
              RESEARCH ON THE MANIPULATION OF THE  
              BODY AND THE SYNETHESTIC EXPERIENTIAL  
              RESEARCH THROUGH SOUND, TASTE, TOUCH,  
              SMELL AND VISION OF THE SENSORIAL  
              THEATRE.
              
              In the collapse of certain "pre-established"  
              structures, the Sensorium (Us) seeks an opening  
              towards rebirth and fulfillment.  
              On vision, smell and sound: it is rare to find an eye
so powerful, so meticulous and so crystalline as to
observe the color of a melody; and there are those
who have spent their entire lives traveling to distant
places, hoping to meet someone who possessed the
quality of knowing how to listen. What sound did that
sensation have? What perfume was it, to have
inebriated me so much, warming my blood?
Events and sufferings create openings, events in the
execution, aimed at discovering what we are, what
we are not and going beyond ego.
We must ask you, we pray and implore you to be
sincere. In every circumstance and occasion that
presents itself from now and on, in every proposal
and question that will be put forward to you, in every
danger and in every victory.
In every moment from now on, there will be no room
for moralisms and ideologies. It is not a false and
attractive judgment that can save you, no more than
a sad and cruel lie.
Laugh like crazy, in the moment you want to. Cry
until your eyes hurt. Scream until you lose your
voice, if you feel the anger exploding in your chest
and pushing to come out.
Close your eyes and dream, until you are sated.

"There is a crack in everything, that's how the light
gets in." said Leonard Cohen

Sensorium is a crack in the social structure, in the
construct of our own egos. Sensorium opens a chink
through which light can shine.
There is such a high universe of senses, where it's
possible to tell tales through sighs.
Therefore, (We) are awakening now, by choice.
We take note of the laws that govern society and
pay them a vision made of wonders, we erect
palaces and towers and castles on dreams and
fears, we travel on the notes of a song played by a
star's orchestra.
We play with raindrops and with the wind, with
flowers and with fire, with smiles and with tears.


1. OUT OF LOGIC, INTO EMBODIED PRACTICE
AND SPIRITUAL BEING.

Sensorium will exit logic forward abstract meaning;
(We) go beyond rational experience into poetry.
Because it wouldn't be a mistake, if anyone wants to
ask the question, to suppose the existence of
incredible events. Events that, perhaps, escape the
evidence.
Nevertheless, the attention required from you in
perceiving absurd manifestations of creation, as well
as the eccentric nature of case, as well as a miracle
hidden behind the most usual functionings of dawn
and dusk, is not easy to apply even for the most
meticulous and smarter minds on the planet.


2. ART: LIFE: POETRY. BREAKING
BOUNDARIES.

We believe that life is only poetry, Art is only poetry,
and they become one.
We believe in the decostruction of colors and
shapes and in the introduction of new harmonies,
sperimentations and perspectives.
There will be neither good or bad emotions, nor
emotions to be ashamed of or to repress, and there
will be no one telling you what ethics you will be
required to observe.
It will be lecit for us to be amazed in front of a mirror,
perceiving what, deeply in the reflection, calls us to
discover mysteries and richnesses.
Sensorium actively explores the crossing of
boundaries between Art and life, moving towards
radicality.
We explore mutable perceptions, facing fears and
shifting reality.
We wear the mask of Pan, as the essence of wild
power and vital, primordial and uncontrollable force.
As an asomatic mask because it portrays, within its
absence, what is not representable and what is not
given to represent.


3. ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

Through performance, we create an opening for
chaos to enter inside a state of liminality, to reset
ourselves and find resonance.
We merge the dreamlike and the corporeal in the
embrace of Saturnalia, offering ourselves in
sacrifice, emerging from the enchantment to reach
ecstasy.
First of all, we must focus our attention on senses.
"How can man find pleasure in the absurd? In fact,
to the extent that people laugh in the world, this
happens; indeed, one can say that almost wherever
there is happiness, there is the pleasure of the
absurd." said Friedrich Nietzsche.
Explain it with horrifying and frightening visions;
hidden in the terror, resounds a melody of dull notes,
the sweetest and most thunderous that can be
heard.
There are apocalyptic landscapes where the death,
the nature, a mother and a machine reign supreme.
Its gears are lubricated by blood, its pistons push
crowds of men and women towards unjustifiable
choices and in its valves flow rivers of words and
thoughts that covet to be written, but instead they
drain into the deep darkness of a sewer.
This reality is tyrannical, devoid of any color, it
seizes every dignity and vitality.


4. NON-HIERARCHY OF MATERIALS.

We maintain that if life and Art are the same thing,
the same goes for expirience materials, in its
multisensory and non-hierarchical nature. A human
arm is the same thing as milk, it is the same thing as
a canvas. A human arm is the same thing as human
genitals and a human face.
In the synaesthetics of art, a melody becomes
tactile, a light is felt from its scent, pain echoes in the
sound of our voice. All these participations return to
be evoked and to evoke in a textual, visual, material
and gestural level.
Each material is treated with awareness, highlighting
the systems in which the human body interacts with
material objects and offering an analytical lens
through which we reflect on how, depending on the
sense involved, the properties and bodily
characteristics of objects can induce interaction, with
all the respect and attention that is due to them.


5. STRUCTURES OTHER THAN HUMAN.

We, Sensorium, aim to move towards non-human
forms. We imitate the ecosystems and structures
present in the mycelium and the rhizoids.
In action, we become an organism. Each offers the
opening, triggers an endocrine process with its
ligands, releases its own energies and emotions,
aware that others will be able to receive and grasp
them. Our touch raises synaptic bridges towards
others.
We express ourselves in a paracrine and autocrine
way and by reaching each other in the
entanglement, in catharsis, we explode in the
Magnificent Entropy.
We observe the movement of the stars to reproduce
them.
From the Magnificent Entropy of chaotic processes,
we gravitate towards meaning, we forge the signifier.
We listen to the synapses in the weaving of the
planet to transcribe them.
We perform the macabre danse on the beat of its
pulsating core.


6. BEING HERE NOW: THE CLAUSE OF
RADICAL PRESENCE THROUGH
IMPROVISATION AND INSTINCT.

Sensorium uses improvisation and instinct as tools
for performance and creation in life.
From Chaos to form, openings are offered to us or
created by us, through engagement with Radical
Presence.
What is Radical Presence?
This is attuned to the practice of being here and
now, surrendering totally in acceptance of what is
here and now. The act of being here and now.
Relax your nerves, now. If you hide the anger, let it
flow. Define pleasure. Do it with passionate words,
tell what the taste of flesh and the smell of sex are.


7. ON NUDITY AND LANGUAGE.

We explore movement and nudity, as a way to
deconstruct social rules and liberate natural bodies.
That the body is nothing but the emulation of the
union of cosmic and ancestral principles, that it is
celebrated and not concealed.
We also sustain that morphological language is a
sinful act, a fad and a service.
That language can be sound material and can be 
deconstructed as an associative sensory tool.
So that the body becomes language and language
resonates in the body, elevating the word to the
union of all its meanings and its experiential load.
Many bodies and many languages, as notes of the
same score, variations of the theme of a harmonious
and indivisible song.


8. NON-JUDGEMENT, ART-LIFE PARTITIONS
AND THE FUSION OF IDENTITY: COMMUNITY
AND AUTONOMY.

Sensorium works with the fusion of identity to create
collective bodies without hierarchy and with common
positions, in which the community is valued more
than individual comfort and all individuals have
equal autonomy and decision-making power.
We aim to perceive all impulses as revelations and
without prejudice.
Sensorium, we experience life and Art as equals,
interconnected and with a fluid and permeable skin.
We value pleasant situations and painful ones, with
the same weight and importance.
We have an anti-hierarchical approach to the
spectrum of emotions, sensations and experiences.


9. POST-ACTIONISM: CONTEXTUALIZATION.

Sensorium, we come from a context spearheaded
by Wiener Aktionismus, Happening and Fluxus, as
well as from their persistent social and political
backgrounds.
We are actively engaged in what could be
considered Post-Actionism, or third wave of avant-
garde.
We adhere to a Dadaist vision of reality, marked by
encounter and we're determined to paint ideal forms,
of dissent, in existence.
The latters, perhaps to provoke or perhaps to make
reflections on vital, political, social issues.
Inside and outside conventional forms of artistic
expression.
We are awared that Art releases a manifestation of
the spirit and by virtue of this it cannot be considered
not a political act, rather a human act.


10. WE CANNOT LIVE, WE CANNOT CHANGE, IF
WE DON'T ACCEPT.

Sensorium diverges from civilization as a rule or a
structure and aims to return to create a natural
existence together.
An understandable reaction, no doubt, would be to
look away.
And yet, we dare to exasperate this fragile intuition.
We push hope to the rebellion, to the point of
shaping new rules for the world, and so an idea
takes form. An innocent whim of the mind, for which
we would feel pity.
It would not be complicated, it would be
understandable, to believe it an appearance. A
tragic creature.
Let us dare again. Let us gather the creature, resist
the primal impulse to crush it into oblivion, guard it
jealously. Let us cuddle and nourish it. Let us warm
it in our laps.
Let us admire its enchantment – as it grows,
mutating, cumbersome and acrobatics images will
appear.
It will arise changed, an idea of great value. The
monster of ecstasy.
It is not wise to try to think of it in terms of good or
evil. We will discover, weighing its potential, that it
travels and holds on a border, perfectly at ease,
perfectly in balance; and if we were doubting at the
point to apply human tools, we would finally notice
the level of perfection it reaches.
The exact proportion of its forms, the precious
harmony with which it evolves, the distinct ringing it
produces in the soul. Using intellect and instinct in
the right measure, we will be able to hear its voice,
its jolt.

              If we know how to employ the right grace, we will be  
              able to grasp its surface and then its essence.

                <div class="manifest-title">> MANIFESTO NO. 2 (Interpreted by Alina Trionow, November 2024)</div>

                    SENSORIUM MANIFESTO NO. 2
                    
                    0.  
                    
                    SENSORIUM is a social practice.
                    SENSORIUM exists only in a process-orientated way. 
                    SENSORIUM declares events to be the central statement.
                    
                    The manifesto is a method.
                    The manifesto is undogmatic.
                    
                
                    1. TRANSGRESSION
                    
                    We pursue an active principle.
                    Activity is the opposite of apathy.
                    The being is active in its principle.
                    Activity is permanent movement.
                    It works through the process.
                    
                    The active principle is amoral. 
                    It transgresses. 
                    It gives birth to itself through destruction. 
                    It understands everything that exists as information, not as judgement.
                    
                    SENSORIUM is the framework for transgression.
                    

                    2.  REWILDING
                    
                    Our subject is the entire spectrum of sensation.
                    The treatment is performative.
                    By transgressing one’s own and social boundaries
                    the relationship between all emotions is horizontal.
                    
                    Our occasion is the reorganization
                    of our physical condition,
                    of our mental attitude,
                    of our social existence.
                    
                    SENSORIUM is the withdrawal from the intervention in sensation through judgement.
                    

                    3. CHAOS 
                    
                    Transgression opens an empty space.
                    Total chaos rains in it.
                    Totality doesn’t know the second.
                    It’s a state outside of time.
                    
                    Chaos is a shape-shifter.
                    It reveals itself ambivalently.
                    In the simultaneity of creation and destruction
                    it has not yet enacted a law.
                    
                    We follow chaos through Performance without knowing where it leads.
                    
                    SENSORIUM is the revitalization of chaos.
                    

                    4. IMPROVISATION/ INSTINCT
                    
                    We untie the instinct through improvisation.
                    We cultivate spontaneity and freedom.
                    During improvisation, the real experience appears.
                    Poetry and life merge into synchronicity.
                    
                    Instinct leads the way through chaos.
                    

                    5. ART AND LIFE 
                    
                    The being is poetic in its essence 
                    and therefore significant and meaningless at the same time.
                    Poetry is the highest form of freedom. 
                    So art and life mean the same thing.
                    
                    Performance happens in the active moment.
                    The play always happens and never happens.
                    

                    6. BODY
                    
                    The body is unbounded.
                    The body is nameless.
                    The body is a material.
                    
                    Tantamount with rain, time, wind, sun and sand.
                    We understand it as a sensual medium for exploration of the self.
                    Through performative action, we transport it into chaos.
                    To where meaning has not been assigned.
                    

                    7. MATERIAL
                    
                    Everything that exists is material.
                    People, matter, rain, time, wind, sun and sand.
                    Every material has an equal status.
                    It acts. 
                    
                    It mediates and communicates. It appears.
                    Its appearance contains information.
                    Without symbolism, it speaks metaphysically and associatively. 
                    Its very existence is an action. 
                    

                    8. LANGUAGE 
                    
                    Language is the mediation of information.
                    Language is an expression.
                    It begins non-verbally. 
                    We speak through silence.
                    Silence speaks to us.
                    
                    Through performative action we forget all words
                    and begin to speak.
                    

                    9. PUBLIC
                    
                    The audience feels through participation.
                    Sensation creates a form.
                    Every form contains information through its expression.
                    Everything that conveys information acts through its effect.
                    The public is part of a landscape.
                    

                    10. COMMUNALITY
                    
                    We delimit ourselves through performative practice. 
                    
                    Collective transgression let us temporally become one.
                    This unity is non-hierarchical.
                    We develop a sense for horizontal communality.
                    We treat care and challenge as a pair.
                    

                    11. TIME AND SPACE
                    
                    A space is formed by what it contains.
                    Content is related to the present.
                    The present is an accumulation of temporality.
                    
                    Every person, every object, every material is content.
                    Their simultaneity is the action. 
                    Every action is therefore site-specific. 
                    No action is repeatable.

                  <p>SENSORIUM MANIFESTO NO. 1

              We are not trying to change the world, we are changing ourselves.
              We are breaking out of our own apathy
              Cultivating synchronicity and spontaneity.
              We are changing ourselves
              Through perforative action.
              Through care but not through tenderness.
              Through a non-hierarchical approach of human experience.
              Through the acceptance of the total spectrum of human emotion.
              We are not developing an ideology, but a practice.
              We are developing a practice
              of performance
              of participatory art
              of Actionism
              That does not coerce the public to act
              but that opens up spaces for their expressions.
              We are developing a practice
              that bases itself on consensual boundary crossing.
              We are developing a practice
              so as to never oppress ourselves again
              With cultural boundaries
              with social norms
              with family expectations.
              We are developing a practice
              that reframes our personal boundaries
              So they become collective ones.
              So they define our experiences rather than limiting them.
              So they root us in the present rather than maintain us in fear.
              We are exploring methodologies that lead to identity fusion
              That lead to a real sense of community
              To a common stance rather than to an individual ease
              To a form of collaboration that ensure autonomous vertical action.
              We are becoming poetry
              We are exploring the surreal rather than describing the real.
              We are putting everything flat on the table
              So the flowers, the milk, the stars, death and freedom
              All have the same value as any other materials.
              We are creating a way of being human
              through the practice of life partitions.
              Through the paths of Control, Abandon and Chaos.
              We are not developing projects, we are opening up worlds.
              We are experiencing accidents as informations rather than as valors.
              We are seeking life, not validation.
              We are defining ourselves as materials
              no lesser nor greater than gold, clay or tears.
              We are undergoing multi-sensorial approaches
              to what it means to be human
              Through the practice of physico-spiritual scores.
              We are using body work as a way to conjure chaos.
              We are existing in a polyglot community
              Exploring the interstices amongst languages and amongst cultures.
              We are going away from word-based language
              We dwell around graphical, physical, instinctive, symbolic
              means of communication.
              We are becoming moss.
              We are spreading like fungi into the soil
              Into the social behaviors and the common imaginaries.
              We are dwelling upon non-human ways to exist as social beings.
              We are rejecting civilisation as a tool of oppression
              So we can emancipate our human interactions
              So we can base them on self-organised local senses.
              We are denying institutions the right to hoard our collective power.
              We are embracing Chaos.
              We are embracing Chaos as a way out of the Anthropocene.
              We are nurturing impermanency as the fundamental tone of reality.
              We are following paths without knowing where they lead.
              We are sublimating our condition.
              We are the blinds roaming through the light.
              We are the intoxicated running through the woods.
              We are showing up naked at the end of the world.
              We are seeking radical change.
              In our Physical states.
              In our Psychical states.
              In our Social existences.
              We are reconnecting to our instincts.
              We are dwelling in the full-spectrum of human possibilities.
              We are writing an ode to spontaneity.
              We are formulating Cosmogonies
              We are becoming Myths.</p>
